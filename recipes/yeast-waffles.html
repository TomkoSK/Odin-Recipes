  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>This is a traditional yeast waffle recipe. It makes tasty, crunchy waffles. They are very good with syrup, 
  or my personal favorite is waffles topped with whipped cream and fresh strawberries!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups milk</li>
    <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
    <li>½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
    <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>3 cups sifted unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 eggs, slightly beaten</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking soda </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Warm milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Combine milk, yeast mixture, butter, salt, sugar, and flour in a large bowl. Mix thoroughly with an 
    electric mixer until batter is smooth. Cover and let stand at room temperature overnight.</li>
    <li>The next morning, preheat a waffle iron.</li>
    <li>Stir beaten eggs and baking soda into batter; beat well.</li>
    <li>Spray the hot waffle iron with nonstick cooking spray. Pour mix onto waffle iron and cook until golden brown.</li>
